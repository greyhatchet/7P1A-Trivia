This is a trivia game with pass and play components. There will be multiple categories of multiple types of questions, with several questions per category. The questions will get harder as the point values increase, and will consist of multiple choice and true false questions. The questions themselves, as well as their answers will be pulled from multiple text files. The categories are yet to be determined, and will be chosen by each group member individually.
